# Wi-Fi Password Retrieval system

This code is a Python program that retrieves Wi-Fi passwords stored on a Windows system using the `netsh` command. It uses the `subprocess` module to interact with the command line and gather information about wireless network profiles and their associated passwords.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your Windows system.
2. Download or copy the code to your local machine.
3. Open a command prompt with administrative privileges.
4. Navigate to the directory where the python file (code) is located.
5. Run the code & you will get data on your screen.

## Important Notes
1. Ethical Considerations: Running codes that access sensitive information like Wi-Fi passwords may be considered unethical or illegal without proper authorization. Use this
   code responsibly and only on systems you own or have explicit permission to access.

2. Administrative Privileges: This code requires administrative privileges to interact with the Windows network settings. Make sure you run the code with administrative
   rights.

3. Security: Storing Wi-Fi passwords in plain text or easily accessible formats is not recommended due to security concerns. Always prioritize security when handling sensitive
   information.
